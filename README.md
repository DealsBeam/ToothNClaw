**Tooth N Claw Xbox Game Bar Widget** brings native, controller-friendly performance tuning directly into your gameplay experience.
- On-the-fly tuning: Adjust APU power and graphics settings instantly from gamebar, mid-game, without interrupting your session.
- Controller-first experience: Designed for handheld and couch gaming — no need to navigate desktop apps with tiny UI elements made for mouse and keyboard.
- Filling Windows XBox Fullscreen Experience gaps letting gamers fine-tune system performance directly from the Xbox Game Bar — no more dropping to Desktop mode for simple APU changes.
- Zero compute footprint: Uses no CPU or GPU compute and has no power impact.

**Tooth N Claw Color Remaster** 

- Bring your games to life with Color Remaster, a hardware-accelerated color enhancement tool inspired by VibrantDeck.
- Remaster your visuals: Transform your game’s color and mood — go full Matrix with deep green hues or recreate the golden tones of Lisan al Gaib from Dune.
- OLED-like experience with punchy colors: Boost your display’s color intensity with Saturation and Contrast controls for rich, vivid output. (Contrast 55, Saturation: 58)
- Hardware-accelerated performance: Powered by LUT (Look-Up Tables) blocks running directly on the display pipeline — 0% GPU compute usage and exceptional power efficiency from Intel.
- Fine-tune your visuals: Adjust Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma to find your perfect balance between light and darkness.

- Next-gen LunarLake/PantherLake sharpness: Unlock Intel Adaptive Sharpening — a novel feature by Intel that enhances blurred or upscaled content for a crisper, more detailed image while preserving natural textures.
- Adaptive Sharpening is Efficient and smart: Runs entirely on Intel’s display engine block — no GPU load, no performance hit, and minimal power draw.
